1. fix catalog_number redundancy (ie. "abc" vs "abc1"), 
 change program in pub_product_exists

2. case 158, GFP with "-" attached usually.

3. case 163 to 167, incorrectly marking immunochistochemical & staining as 2 different technical group,
should not use partental name, should use technique group instead

4. case 176 & 177, change in past program and new logic.
dun mixed up Chromatin Immunoprecipitation = ChIP, but not immunoprecipiatation
	- update into pub_search_tech
	- need update in scripts as well

5. implement point 12.

6. for PMC search, incluce search of Novus

7. share my code to Elvis and David (TBC)
	- define workflow of upload
	- GitHub
		|-prototype
		|-scinapsis			(shared to David repository)
			|-scripts
				|-Plosone
				|-patch_data
				|-prod_tech_search
			|-scin
		|-db_scripts			(shared to David repository)



homework (20150728):
1. sync stored_procedure_revamp.sql and run_product_tech.py
1. verify pub_technique_exists
	- check against immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
2. implement the same CHIP and immunoprecipitation logic to scirpt
